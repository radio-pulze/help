# Recording Guide

NOTE: This guide was written very quickly and may be missing important screenshots and other info. Please contact the technical advisor if you have any questions.

This guide is for recording voice-overs, podcasts or other content that is NOT live broadcast in the studio. For the live broadcast guide, please refer to the physical guide in the studio.

## Choosing the room

There are 2 recording areas available: the broadcast setup in the green room and the recording room inside the blue room.

The broadcast setup is the go to option as it is quick, simple and has a great view (of Starbucks). However, it cannot be used if there is a live broadcast schedule overlapping with your recording session. It also requires everybody else in the room to be quiet while recording.

The recording room has slightly better treatment and allows monitoring without affecting background noises (so other people can talk while someone is recording). However, the room is small and can only fit one (maaaaaybe two) talent. Please have another person (aside from the talent) monitoring the session as the recording computer is outside of the recording room. Not recommended if you have more than 2 people as the blue room is currently packed with Live Lounge equipment.

If you are not sure which room best suits your needs, please contact the technical advisor.

Once you have picked a room, you can refer to the respective setup instructions for the broadcast room or the recording room.

## Broadcast Room Setup

NOTE: This guide assumes there is at least one person present who is familiar with broadcast procedures and can operate the mixer's basic features e.g. mute/unmute, volume/gain control.

### Equipment

If any of the equipment is still on, turn everything off and restart in this order: mixer, headphones amp (under the Mac) and the Mac.

Log in to the Radio Pulze account on the Mac and start up GarageBand.
* If you don't see GarageBand in the taskbar, do <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to open up Spotlight search. Type in `GarageBand` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
* If there is an existing project, just close it and create a new GarageBand project.

Add tracks.
* Go to `Track` > `New Track` in the menu bar at the top. Make sure the input source is a microphone and is the same number as the mic you are using. (The mics are labelled 1 to 4.)
* * The source options might only allow you to select a combination of mics e.g. `Input 1 & 2`. Just use that one.
* Make sure all the mics you are using have been added as input sources. You can add as many tracks as you need.

Make sure all the tracks are armed for recording.
* Click the `Enable recording` button for all the tracks you want to record. This button has a dot in the middle. If the dot is red and lighted up, it means the track is armed for recording.
* * If you don't see this button, right-click the track and select `Track Header Components` -> `Show Record Enable`.

Do a test recording/sound check.
* Click the large record button on GarageBand. You should see all your tracks that have been armed for recording should start recording (a red bar will appear on each of them).
* Unmute your mics and adjust the volume. Speak into the mics and observe the wave on the recording tracks on GarageBand. If there is more than one recording talent at a mic, continue adjusting until everyone's mics is about the same volume level.
* Click the stop button to stop the recording. Move the playhead (the line thing) to the start and play the recording to listen to it through the headphones. Make sure the volume/audio quality sounds good.
* Delete the test recording and move the playhead back to the start. (You can drag the playhead or press <kbd>Return</kbd> to return the playhead to start quickly.)

Start recording.
* After pressing the record button, leave a few seconds of silence before directing the talent to start speaking (about 3 seconds). Then leave a few seconds of silence after the talent finishes the line before stopping the recording. This buffer is very important for post processing.
* IMPORTANT: Play back each recording after it is done to check the quality. The recording setup can occasionally mess up some sounds for no reason.
* Do about 3 takes, or however many requested by the client.
* If you delete bad takes, drag the good recordings right next to each other to avoid having long silences in the finished recording. Alternatively, you can just keep all the recordings but note down the good takes (you can write down the start timings of the good takes on notepad and send them to the editor -- if you don't see any timestamps in GarageBand, change the recording mode to time instead of beats.)

Save frequently!
* Save as a .band file in a temporary location. If GarageBand ever crashes in the middle of recording, you can just reopen that file to restore all your saved work.
* Try to save between every recording. Seriously, it's just a simple <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.
* You can delete the .band file after everything else has been completed.

Export the finished recording.
* Go to `Share` -> `Export Song to Disk` from the top menu and choose the file type as requested by client. (If you're not sure, just save it as a .wav first.) Select your save location and export. You might have to wait a while depending on the length of your recording.

(Editing the recording is not in the scope of this guide. If editing is required, please contact the technical advisor for help.)

### Manpower Setup

Depending on your needs, you can set this up in many different ways.

If you have a technical helper (who is not also a recording talent), the helpers should be in front of the Mac to monitor the recording. The talent will then sit at mics 2 - 4 for their recording session.

The talent can also sit at mic 1 (which is the best mic) but the helpers might have difficulty monitoring the recording since that's where the Mac is.

If the talent is doubling as the technical helper, the talent should sit at mic 1.

If there are any directors present to direct the talent, they should remain silent when recording.

### Troubleshooting

> MAC: How do I connect to the internet?

Go to the WiFi symbol on the top right of the screen and select "NUS_Guest". Follow the on-screen instructions to connect to NUS' network.

> MIXER: Mixer doesn't pick up any sounds!

Check if the mics are unmuted (the mute button lights should be OFF) and the volume/gain is not at the bottom.

Check if the master mix volume is not at the bottom.

If you're not sure, take a photo of the WHOLE mixer and send it to the technical advisor (and explain your problem too).

> GARAGEBAND: The recording is not playing back in the headphones!

Check GarageBand's Settings and make sure the output source is not in-built speakers.

Make sure the headphones amp is on and that the output for each channel is not 0.

Check other headphones or plug in your own personal earphones into the headphones amp. Some of our headphones might be faulty. (Please also mark the faulty ones for us to investigate.)

> GARAGEBAND: GarageBand's recording is just silence!

Make sure you have set up everything correctly on the mixer. You should be able to see the volume response (the green-orange-red) from the mixer.

Check your track inputs on GarageBand and make sure the mic you want is one of the input sources for one of the tracks.

Check GarageBand's Settings and make sure your input source is **Alesis** device and not in-built microphone or some other thing.

> GARAGEBAND: I accidentally deleted a good take and saved the file!

If GarageBand is still open, you should be able to undo until the deleted recording reappears. (Of course, whatever new takes you've recorded after deleting will disappear.)

If this take is super important and you are unable to just do another take (for instance, if the talent has already left and you need to submit the recording soon), you can take a look in the Trash and see if the recording is still there. You might have to restore all of the trashed recordings into a temporary folder and open them in GarageBand, and listen to them individually to identify the recording you want.

If all else fails, you can contact the technical advisor to have a look.

> GARAGEBAND: I can't find the record enable button / this other button!!

Go to `Help` in the menu at the top and type in the thing you are looking for (e.g. "Show Record Enable"). GarageBand should automatically highlight the option you are looking for. Just follow the highlighted menu option and click it.

> HELP! I've tried everything else and I still have a problem!!

Please contact the technical advisor for assistance. Alternatively, you could try to Google it.

## Recording Room Setup

### Equipment

Right outside the recording room, there is a large mixer and a Mac computer. Both of these should already been turned on. Just move the mouse a little to wake up the Mac if the screen is blank.

Log in to the Mac (ask the technical advisor for login details, it's not the same as the broadcast computer).

Open Logic Pro.
* If you don't see Logic Pro in the taskbar, do <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to open up Spotlight search. Type in `Logic Pro` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Add tracks.
* Unlike in the broadcast room, you need to add Input 1 and Input 2 on 2 separate tracks. Input 1 is the mic inside the recording room and Input 2 is the mic outside.
* On the tracks, you should see a button with the letter `I` and a button with the letter `R`. Make sure the track with Input 1 has `I` and `R` enabled and the track with Input 2 has `I` enabled (but not `R`). `R` arms your track for recording and `I` puts the track on a feedback mode, so you can listen to that mic in real time. This is for the talent in the recording room to hear the people outside.

Check if you can hear each other through the two rooms.
* Once the track with Input 2 has `I` enabled, the talent should enter the recording room and put on the headphones. Make sure the headphones amp is on (the power button is the large square button on the right). The people outside should speak into the mic outside and test if the talent can hear them. Once this has been established, you can disable `I` to prevent the talent from hearing the outside gossip.
* * You can leave the outside mic turned on throughout, but the background noise from outside (e.g. bumping into equipment) might confuse people while they are monitoring the recording.
* The talent should speak into the mic inside and the people outside should be able to hear them through the headphones connected to the mixer.
* * NOTE: The headphones port on the mixer isn't the best, so you might have to fiddle with the 3.5mm jack and try to nudge it around to see what orientation works.

Do a test recording/soundcheck.
* Press the record button (either on the mixer or on Logic) and hold it for a bit until the playhead starts moving on the Mac. Note that the playhead (the moving line thing) will start from beyond the starting point and keep moving. Wait until the playhead has moved past the starting point and wait a little while more before asking the talent to start speaking. Also wait a few seconds after the talent has finished their lines before stopping.
* If you hear a lot of ticking sounds consistently playing, check if the metronome was turned on in Logic (bottom left corner). Make sure the button is NOT blue.
* Click the stop button to stop the recording. Move the playhead to the start and play the recording to listen to it through the headphones. Make sure the volume/audio quality sounds good.
* Delete the test recording and move the playhead back to the start.

Start recording.
* After pressing the record button, wait for the playhead to cross the starting point, leave a few seconds of silence before directing the talent to start speaking (about 3 seconds). Then leave a few seconds of silence after the talent finishes the line before stopping the recording. This buffer is very important for post processing.
* Do about 3 takes, or however many requested by the client.
* If you delete bad takes, drag the good recordings right next to each other to avoid having long silences in the finished recording. Alternatively, you can just keep all the recordings but note down the good takes (you can write down the start timings of the good takes on notepad and send them to the editor.)

Export the finished recording.
* Go to `File` -> `Export` -> `Track as Audio File` from the top menu and choose the file type as requested by client. (If you're not sure, just save it as a .wav first.) Select your save location and export. You might have to wait a while depending on the length of your recording.

(Editing the recording is not in the scope of this guide. If editing is required, please contact the technical advisor for help.)

### Manpower Setup

The talent should be in the recording room and everyone else should be outside.

The technical helpers should be in control of the Mac and outside mic. If there is a director present to direct the talent, both the technical helper and the director should head headphones on to monitor the recording. If the director wishes to speak to the talent, they should inform the technical helper, who will enable the outside mic so the talent inside can hear them.

Although both sides should be able to hear each other, it is recommended to use a visual hand signal (such as a thumbs up) to cue the talent. This is to prevent unnecessary enabling/disabling of the outside mic, which might confuse the people present.

### Troubleshooting

> I can't hear the talent!

Enable `I` for the track with mic 1.

> The talent cannot hear us!

Enable `I` for the track with mic 2. Please also check that the headphones amp in the recording room is on and the headphones are plugged into it properly. Check if the volume on the amp is more than 0.

> I don't want the talent to hear us!

Disable `I` on the track with mic 2.

> How do I record 2 talents in the recording room?

If their reads are in real time simultaneously (e.g. conversation, saying things in unison), both talent will have to be in the booth at the same time and use that mic.

if their reads can be recorded separately, send one talent in at a time and record their lines separately. Then disable `R` on the track with the recordings, create another track for Input 1 with `R` enabled and record the second talent.

> LOGIC: I left mic 2 on `I` throughout and bumped into the mic many times. Will this affect the recording?

If `R` is not enabled, it will not be recorded so your recording is fine. However, the headphones will pick up anything with `I`. If you are checking your recording, I'd recommend disabling mic 2 to listen to the recording without outside noises.
